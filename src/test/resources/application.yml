      max-lifetime: 300000 #  Sets the maximum lifetime of a connection in the pool. An in-use connection will never retire. HikariCP removes it only when it is closed. The minimum value is 30000 ms (30 seconds). The default value is 1800000 ms (30 minutes)
      idle-timeout: 10000 # Sets the maximum amount of time that a connection can to sit idle in the pool. This setting only applies when minimumIdle is less than maximum-pool-size. The minimum value is 10000ms (10 seconds). The default value is 600000 (10 minutes).
      keepalive-time: 30000 # Sets how frequently HikariCP will attempt to keep a connection alive. The minimum value you can set is 30000 ms (30 seconds). However, a value in the range of minutes is most desirable. The default is 0 which disables this setting.
